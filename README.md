# DVAA
A group project for CMP311 Professional Project Planning and Prototyping. 

The client requested a functional Android application which could be used by security professionals and developers alike to obtain knowledge regarding mobile application exploitation and specific scenarios/examples. 

The repo also contains the documentation for the reverse engineering vulnerability and a partial version of the White Paper requested by the client (separately uploaded). The names and sections of teammates were removed for privacy reasons. They will be added back to the White Paper if I receive their permission.)

Additionally, only one out of three vulnerabilities is available. The other two were developed by teammates and will be included when I obtain their permission and they provide me with the appropriate code. 

All information available in the repository is for educational purposes only. Attempting any sort of penetration testing without permission is illegal and culprits will be prosecuted.
