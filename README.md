# DVAA
A group project for CMP311 Professional Project Planning and Prototyping. 

The client requested functional Android application which could be used by security professionals and developers alike to obtain knowledge regarding mobile application exploitation and specific scenarios/examples. 

The repo also contains the documentation for the reverse engineering vulnerability and a partial version of the White Paper requested by the client. The names and sections of teammates were removed for privacy reasons. They will be added back to the White Paper if I receive their permission.)
